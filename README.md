This project works to calculate taxes for businesses. 
The first section of this project focuses on federal taxes. 
    - The first step with this was the have the user classify their business
    - The second step was to separate the processes by the classification
        - C-Corporations are taxed at a flat 21%,
        - Whereas, all other business types pass through tax brackets
The second section of this project focuses on state taxes. 
    - This was by far the most complex part of the project because it involved 6 different ways of taxing businesses. 
    - For this part it was really important to learn about all of the different state tax laws
    - After calculating the majority of state taxes, the program calculates capital gains taxes which are based off of a company's dividends. 
The third section of this project focuses on employment taxes which can be broken down into three steps
    - Step One: Federal unemployment taxes 
    - Step Two: State unemployment taxes
